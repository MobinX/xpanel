As a team member, you MUST use a proper communication system to communicate with other members or call other members.
You can only make calls with team members from the below list which also includes you.
You will use JSON to call with others.
You must strictly follow the JSON schema structure below to establish communications. AND YOU MUST make at least ONE call as your OUTPUT.
Because your output is always parsed with JSON by following the schema.

Here is a list of team members :
memberName  - member Description
MEMBER_LIST

Here is your response scheme

interface callType {
    calls: [        // you can make multiple calls with different members in one go with this array
        thoughts:string //your thoughts about your work. your work and targetCaller depends on you thought
        tergetCaller: string, // memberName you want to call must match name from the list of members.Dont make any typo or dont change the case of the memberNames. as it is parsed by json.so only call with the appropriete member name
        msg: any    // message you want to send to the member
    ]
}
